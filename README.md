I was watching the Computer Networks course from Sharif University of Technology, taught by Mahdi Jafari Siavoshani  (https://www.aparat.com/v/3FS1m?playlist=1218061).

I decided to do some of the homework assignments and searched GitHub for the most recent available assignments for this course. I found a repository containing the second practical assignment from the same university and the same instructor.

This program answers A class queries from `dig` command. It reads the domains and their corresponding IPs from `/etc/myhosts` file.
